# Personal Advent of Code solutions

Contains my own solutions to [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/), in Rust. Public mainly to share and compare
with friends.

If you want to run it, you'll need

- Linux/MacOS with Cargo/Rust latest stable
- AoC API key in a file called `api_key` at the root.
- Your email/some identifier in `user_agent` file at the root.
- Souce `./env.sh`.

Run like

```sh
. ./env.sh
cd aoc2025
cargo run --bin day1
```
